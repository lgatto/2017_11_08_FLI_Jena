## Mapping the sub-cellular proteome

In biology, localisation is function. Cells display a complex
sub-cellular structure with numerous distinct niches responsible for
specific biological processes. Consequently, not only must proteins be
present in a cell to accomplish their biological functions, but they
must be localised in their intended sub-cellular locations. In
contrast, mis-localised proteins can have serious advert
consequences. In this talk, I will describe how contemporary
experimental and computational technologies can be used to produce
proteome-wide proteins localisation maps, and how these findings are
supported by an open and collaborative suite of software packages.
